#
# @brief Script that plots a bar plot of tasks executed on different threads in
# a shared memory parallel context, which is useful to identify serial parts of
# the code and load imbalances between different threads.
#
# The script takes a single command line parameter: the number of threads that
# should be plotted. The script then assumes that an equal number of
# corresponding 'jobtimes_X.txt' files exists in the current working directory,
# with X in [0, number of threads[.
#
# To produce these files, configure the code with the
# -DACTIVATE_OUTPUT_CYCLES=True option. Note that this has a considerable impact
# on the runtime and output size of the code, so this is only suitable for
# relatively small simulations.
