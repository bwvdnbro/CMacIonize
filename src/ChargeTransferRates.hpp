/**
 * @brief Recombination and ionization rates due to charge transfer reactions
 * with hydrogen and helium.
 *
 * The rates for hydrogen are based on Kingdon, J. B. & Ferland, G. J. 1996,
 * ApJS, 106, 205 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJS..106..205K), tables 1
 * and 3.
 *
 * The rates for helium are based on Arnaud, M. & Rothenflug, R. 1985, A&AS, 60,
 * 425 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985A%26AS...60..425A), table III.
 *
 * Note that this class does not store any data, so we could make the member
 * functions static. However, we might want to use tabulated values at some
 * point in the future, and then it will be useful that this class is treated as
 * being non-static in other parts of the program.
