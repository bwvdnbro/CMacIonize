STARBENCH benchmark

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a single stellar
source at the centre. The radiation from the star will ionize a spherical region
surrounding the star, that will grow over time as the hydrodynamics reacts to
the energy input from the source.

This particular version uses a co-moving Voronoi grid. This test does not work
with the task-based algorithm.

There are several approximate analytic expressions for the radius of the ionized
region as a function of time.

The test can be run using the provided parameter file (starbench_voronoi.param).
To analyze the results, use the Python script (starbench_voronoi.py).

List of files necessary for this benchmark test:
input:starbench_voronoi.param
input:starbench_voronoi.yml
input:starbench_voronoi.py
