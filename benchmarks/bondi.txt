Bondi accretion benchmark

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a point mass at the
center and a constant inflow of material at the boundaries. On a time scale that
is roughly equivalent to the free fall time of a test particle at the boundary
of the box that feels the gravity of the point mass, the system will evolve into
a steady state accretion flow with a known analytic Bondi profile.

The test can be run using the provided parameter file (bondi.param). To
analyze the results, use the Python script (bondi.py).

List of files necessary for this benchmark test:
