Dusty galaxy benchmark

This benchmark consists of a galaxy luminosity model with a bulge and a disc,
with in the centre a disc of dust that scatters light. The parameters of both
the source disc and the dust disc can be customized, as well as the source
bulge to total ratio.

This setup is used in a galaxy lab taught at the University of St Andrews.

This test can be run using the provided parameter file dusty_galaxy.param
(the extra command line option --dusty-radiative-transfer is required for this
test!). The resulting galaxy image can be plotted using the provided Python
script.
