Stromgren benchmark: diffuse field version

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a single stellar
source at the centre. The radiation from the star will ionize a spherical
region surrounding the star, the size of which can be analytically found.

This version of the test also includes diffuse reemission from the ionized
region.

The test can be run using the provided parameter file
(stromgren_diffuse.param). To analyze the results, use the Python script
(stromgren_diffuse.py).
