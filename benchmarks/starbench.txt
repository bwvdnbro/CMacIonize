STARBENCH benchmark

This benchmark consists of a homogeneous density field with a single stellar
source at the centre. The radiation from the star will ionize a spherical region
surrounding the star, that will grow over time as the hydrodynamics reacts to
the energy input from the source.

There are several approximate analytic expressions for the radius of the ionized
region as a function of time.

The test can be run using the provided parameter file (starbench.param). To
analyze the results, use the Python script (starbench.py).

List of files necessary for this benchmark test:
input:starbench.param
input:starbench.yml
